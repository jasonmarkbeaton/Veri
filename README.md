<h1>Veri is a Database-free location sharing application</h1>
<br>
<p>This was an experiment to figur eout how to build an application to share information without having to create a database to store information.
Inspired by <a href="www.benhowdle.im">Ben Howdle</a> I learned how he utilized Handlebars templating, Bit.ly link sharing, and some fancy css stylings.</p>
<br>
<p>I plan on implementing Text messaging using Twilio for easier sharing</p>
